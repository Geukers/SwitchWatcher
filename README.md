# SwitchWatcher

## Find yourself a Nintendo Switch

Given the high demand of Nintendo's console, my sister was unable to find herself one. Therefore, I created this application to help her get one. After deploying this app, she was able to buy one the same day.

## How it works

The app works by refreshing the best buy page every minute and verifying if the link is clickable. If it is, it makes a noise letting you know to check the website.

## How to make it work

1. Allow Python to use Chrome by downloading chrome driver from here : https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
2. Run the application. I created and ran the application using PyCharm, and it worked like a charm.
  * You can look for different products on Best Buy by changing the URLs in "best_buy_links"
